# EndALS 2025 Validation Workflow

The repository contains the validation workflow for the
[EndALS 2025 Challenge].

## Challenge Overview

The challenge is split into three tasks:

1. ### Subtyping and Pathway Analysis

    Participants must produce a list of clusters or subgroups in
    the ALS population, ordered by prevalence, and annotated with
    relevant pathways. These subgroups should be compared against
    control populations.


2. ### Clinical Symptom Trajectories

    Participants must generate a list of clinical symptoms
    reported in ALS patients, along with the average timeline
    and sequence of their appearance. This includes symptoms
    before and after diagnosis, and ordering relative to one
    another.


4. ### Genetic, Transcriptomic, and Clinical Features

    Participants must provide a list of genetic variants,
    transcripts, and clinical symptoms most prevalent in the
    ALS population. Submissions may also integrate combinations
    of these factors to reveal multimodal ALS signatures.
